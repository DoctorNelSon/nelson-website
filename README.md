# Welcome to Nelson website

## [Free](https://nelson-numerical-software.github.io/nelson-website/COPYING.md) Scientific Software Package

The aim of Nelson is providing a powerful open computing environment for engineering and scientific applications using modern C/C++ libraries (Boost, Eigen, ...) and others state of art numerical libraries. 

It has sophisticated data structures (including cell, struct, linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level programming language. 

Nelson has been developped to be an open/mmodular system where an user can define these own data types and operations on these data types by using overload.
