## [Free](FAQ_LICENSE.md) Scientific Software Package

The aim of Nelson is providing a powerful open computing environment for engineering and scientific applications using modern C/C++ libraries (Boost, Eigen, FFTW, ...) and others state of art numerical libraries.

It has sophisticated data structures (including cell, struct, linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level programming language.

Nelson has been developed to be an open/modular system where an user can define these own data types and operations on these data types by using overload.
